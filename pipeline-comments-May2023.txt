Code questions / bugs
1. So the files that start with the numbers are the scripts that include the tasks and input/output that the pipeline needs to know what it needs to run. 

2. The file named nanoflow-cli contains the whole workflow that will be run when you enter the command (e.g. --trim or --assemble) in the command line. 

3. BUG CANU - line 701 you will also find the overlap length and min read length --> which is 300/200 and 200/50 for the 75000 subsampling and twice 300/200 for 50000 subsampling. 

4. BUG to check that is described in SOP workflow in green, step map to taregt pathegoen: it ssays map to 'contaminants' while it should be MAP on clean reads --> how is the code?
